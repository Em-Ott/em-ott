Hello! <br>
My name is Emily Ott (she, her, hers) and I'm a second year at Northeastern University. During my freshman year I attended Gonzaga University. <br>
I started learning how to use Godot and GDScript recently and I am currently working on a Tetris game in Godot. In class I have also started learning DrRacket. Next semester I'll be learning some Java in Fundamentals of CS II. And in the summer I hope to take Object-Oriented Design. <br>
I have previous experience with C++, JavaScript, HTML/CSS and made a small game in JavaScript during GU's annual Hackathon where I learned JavaScript from scratch! I also made a chess game in the terminal in C++ during summer 2024. In October 2024 I worked with a team on a game for Ludum Dare and tried Unity for the first time, learning how to code and adjust player movement as well as work with collisions. <br>
I hope in the future to be able to keep exploring CS. I'm interested in software and game development, and I hope to continue to be able to do personal projects and further my understanding of programming.
