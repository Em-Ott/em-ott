Hello! <br>
My name is Emily Ott (she, her, hers) and I'm a freshman at Gonzaga University. <br>
I started learning C++ this semester and currently working on a chess game that is played in terminal. <br>
I have previous experience with JavaScript, HTML/CSS and have made a small game in JavaScript during GU's annual Hackathon where I learned JavaScript from scratch! <br>
I hope in the future to be able to explore CS more. Right now the areas I'm exploring are machine learning, cybersecurity, and game development.
