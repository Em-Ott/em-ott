Hello! <br>
My name is Emily Ott (she, her, hers) and I'm a second year at Northeastern University. During my freshman year I attended Gonzaga University. <br>
I started learning how to use Godot and GDScript recently and am currently working on a Tetris game in Godot. <br>
I have previous experience with C++ JavaScript, HTML/CSS and have made a small game in JavaScript during GU's annual Hackathon where I learned JavaScript from scratch! I also made a chess game in the terminal in C++ during the spring semester and early summer. <br>
I hope in the future to be able to explore CS more. Right now the areas I'm exploring are machine learning, cybersecurity, and game development. Game development is the one I'm interested in the most and really hope to continue working with.
